**Husarnet** - simply connect your devices

Husarnet is a different kind of VPN - it's not installed on routers, but directly on your devices. It's a **global scale peer-to-peer network** that allows you to connect your devices **directly in a secure and easy way**, even if they are behind NAT or firewall. Each of your devices gets it's own IPv6 address (in Husarnet's fc94::/64 range) and, using our dashboard, you can specify which devices can communicate with each other. You can also **share your devices** with your coworkers or friends, without the need to overcomplicate your networking setup, all through our dashboard, using the addresses your devices already have!

It's a great solution for robotics, IoT, real-time communication, remote access, and many more. All the software that runs on your devices is **open-source**, so you're still in control. Our plans start at reasonable **free** (that's perfectly usable even for long term deployments) and end at **custom solutions for enterprise needs**.
